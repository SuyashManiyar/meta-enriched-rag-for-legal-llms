To determine the relevance of the given segment to the user query, let's analyze the content and intent of both.

The query inquires about the permissions one can grant, which typically relates to actions or rights one can assign, such as editing, deleting, or managing certain resources.

The segment discusses managing subscriptions, deactivating an account, and removing an active profile. This information pertains to actions one can take on their account but does not directly address the permissions or rights one can grant.

Given that the query is specifically about permissions one can grant, and the segment focuses on actions one can take, the segment is not directly relevant to the user query.

```json
{
  "reasoning": "The segment discusses actions one can take on their account (e.g., managing subscriptions, deactivating an account) rather than permissions one can grant, which is the focus of the query.",
  "final_label": "Irrelevant"

The query asks if any information about the user is released, which implies concern about data privacy and transparency. The provided segment discusses the definition of personal data in the context of a Privacy Policy. While it does touch on privacy, it does not explicitly mention releasing or protecting user information, nor does it address the user's concern about being informed about such information. Therefore, it does not directly relate to the query.

```json
{
  "reasoning": "The segment discusses the definition of personal data in a Privacy Policy but does not address the user's concern about information being released or protected.",
  "final_label": "Irrelevant"
}

RAW OUTPUT:
To determine if the segment is relevant to the query, let's break down the key points:
- The query asks about data usage by an app, specifically whether it uses data not within the app.
- The segment links to Google's privacy policy.
- While Google is a common app, its privacy policy alone doesn't directly address the specific question about app data usage.

To determine the relevance of the given segment to the query, let's break it down:

- The query asks if something sends information to a third party.
- The segment discusses encryption practices for messages sent to Viber servers and to a third party (which is explicitly mentioned).
- The mention of a third party in the context of receiving messages from Viber servers directly relates to the query about sending information to a third party.

Based on this analysis, the segment is directly relevant to the user's query.

2. Understand the segment: "Aggregate Information: information that has been combined with that of other users and analyzed or evaluated as a whole, such that no specific individual may be reasonably identified."
3. Check if the segment directly addresses the query:
   - The segment talks about aggregate information, which is information that has been combined with other users.
   - It mentions that this combined information cannot be identified as belonging to a specific individual.
   - The segment does not explicitly mention sharing or third-party involvement.
4. Determine if the segment is relevant or irrelevant:
   - The segment, while discussing aggregate information, does not directly address the query about third-party sharing.
   - It might be indirectly relevant because third-party sharing could be inferred if the aggregate information is shared, but it does not explicitly state this.
5. Make a decision:
   - The segment is relevant in a broader context but not directly relevant to the specific query about third-party sharing.

```json
{
  "reasoning": "The segment discusses aggregate information, which is a related concept but does not explicitly address the query about third-party sharing.",

PROMPT:
You are a legal expert, classifier that determines if a segment of text from a document is relevant to a user query.

Query: "does the app show targeted advertisements?"
Segment: "LoopMe - https://loopme.com/privacy/"

Decide whether the segment is RELEVANT or IRRELEVANT to the query.

Respond in JSON only, in this format:
{
  "reasoning": "Your reasoning here in one or two sentences",
  "final_label": "Relevant" | "Irrelevant"
}
RAW OUTPUT:
To determine the relevance of the given segment to the query, let's analyze it step by step:

The query asks specifically about "targeted advertisements" and mentions an app, implying the user is interested in information related to how an app handles advertising. The segment provided contains a link to LoopMe's privacy policy, which does not directly address targeted advertisements within the app itself.

Given that the privacy policy link does not provide specific information about the app's use of targeted advertisements, it is not directly relevant to the user's query.

Therefore, the final label is:
{
  "reasoning": "The segment contains a link to LoopMe's privacy policy, which does not provide specific information about targeted advertisements within the app, making it irrelevant to the query.",
  "final_label": "Irrelevant"
}
REASONING: The segment contains a link to LoopMe's privacy policy, which does not provide specific information about targeted advertisements within the app, making it irrelevant to the query.

} The segment is somewhat relevant as it touches on data collection and usage, which could be related to the concern about selling information. However, it does not directly address the query about whether information will be sold. Therefore, it leans towards being relevant but not directly answering the specific question. Based on this analysis, I'm labeling it as "Relevant."

{
  "reasoning": "The segment discusses data collection and usage, which is tangentially related to the user's concern about selling information, though it does not explicitly address the question of selling.",
  "final_label": "Relevant"

{
  "reasoning": "The segment mentions data collection and usage, which is related to the user's concern about selling information, even though it does not directly address whether information will be sold.",

2. Analyze the given segment: "Should you have any questions relating to this Privacy Policy, please contact us at info@limasky.com."
3. Check if the segment directly or indirectly addresses the query:
   - The segment mentions a Privacy Policy, which could be relevant to data sharing.
   - It asks for a question related to the Privacy Policy.
   - However, the segment does not explicitly state whether the information will be shared.
   - It provides a contact method, but it's not directly about the sharing status.
4. Conclude based on the analysis: The segment is somewhat related to the query but does not provide a clear answer about whether something will be shared.

Respond in JSON only, in this format:
{
  "reasoning": "Your reasoning here in one or two sentences",
  "final_label": "Relevant" | "Irrelevant"

RAW OUTPUT:
To determine the relevance, let's analyze the segment and the query:

The query asks if other users can see personal information when using Groupon. The segment discusses connecting with a social network and posting Groupon activity back to it, but it doesn't explicitly mention personal information or privacy settings.

However, since the query specifically asks about personal info, and the segment implies that Groupon activity could be shared publicly through social networks, it's reasonable to infer that personal information could be visible to other users.

Therefore, the segment is somewhat relevant to the query, even though it doesn't directly state personal information.

```json
{
  "reasoning": "The segment mentions sharing Groupon activity through social networks, which could potentially include personal information. While it does not explicitly state personal information, it implies the possibility of it being visible to other users.",
  "final_label": "Relevant"
}
```
REASONING: The segment mentions sharing Groupon activity through social networks, which could potentially include personal information. While it does not explicitly state personal information, it implies the possibility of it being visible to other users.

You are a legal expert, classifier that determines if a segment of text from a document is relevant to a user query.

Query: "what will you do with my dna?"
Segment: "Your Genetic Information and/or Self-Reported Information will be used for research purposes, but it will be de-identified and will not be linked to your Registration Information."

Decide whether the segment is RELEVANT or IRRELEVANT to the query.

Respond in JSON only, in this format:
{
  "reasoning": "Your reasoning here in one or two sentences",

RAW OUTPUT:
To solve this, follow these steps:
1. Understand the query: "What will you do with my DNA?"
2. Analyze the segment: "Your Genetic Information and/or Self-Reported Information will be used for research purposes, but it will be de-identified and will not be linked to your Registration Information."
3. Determine if the segment addresses the query.
4. Classify the segment as RELEVANT or IRRELEVANT based on your analysis.

{
  "reasoning": "The segment discusses how genetic and self-reported information will be used for research purposes, which could be related to what will happen to the user's DNA. However, it does not directly address the user's query about their specific DNA data being used or handled.",
  "final_label": "Relevant"
} Based on the provided segment, which discusses the use of genetic and self-reported information for research purposes, but does not directly address the user's query about their specific DNA data being used or handled, the appropriate classification is:

```json
{
  "reasoning": "Although the segment mentions research purposes for genetic information, it does not specifically address the user's query about their DNA being handled or used, making it somewhat relevant but not directly answering the query.",
  "final_label": "Relevant"
}
``` 

The reasoning is that while the segment is somewhat related to the query, it does not directly answer the user's specific question about their DNA data. Therefore, the segment is classified as "Relevant" but with a note that it is not a direct response to the query. 

However, given the options provided, a more fitting label might be "Irrelevant" since the segment does not directly address the user's query about their specific DNA data. 

```json
{
  "reasoning": "The segment mentions research purposes for genetic information but does not directly address the user's query about their specific DNA data being used or handled.",
  "final_label": "Irrelevant"
}
``` 

This classification is more accurate as it directly addresses the user's query about their specific DNA data, which the segment does not cover. 

```json
{
  "reasoning": "The segment discusses the use of genetic information for research purposes but does not specifically address the user's query about their DNA data being used or handled.",
  "final_label": "Irrelevant"
}
``` 

This classification is the most appropriate as it clearly indicates the segment is not directly addressing the user's query about their specific DNA data.
REASONING: The segment discusses how genetic and self-reported information will be used for research purposes, which could be related to what will happen to the user's DNA. However, it does not directly address the user's query about their specific DNA data being used or handled.

Respond in JSON only, in this format:
{
  "reasoning": "Your reasoning here in one or two sentences",
  "final_label": "Relevant" | "Irrelevant"

RAW OUTPUT:
To determine if the given segment is relevant to the query, let's analyze it:

The segment discusses the need for personal information to complete purchases through Keep, mentioning specific types of information required. While it does not directly mention the query "what permissions do you need," it provides context that could be related to the broader topic of permissions required for purchases.

The query is asking about permissions in a more general sense, while the segment is specifically about the types of information needed for a purchase. The two are related but not identical. The segment could imply that certain permissions are necessary to process purchases, but it doesn't explicitly state or explain what those permissions are.

Therefore, the segment provides some relevant context but is not a direct answer to the query.

```json

Segment: "When you use our Services, including our website or mobile app(s), our third party service providers may collect Web-Behavior Information about your visit, such as the links you clicked on, the duration of your visit, and the URLs you visited."

Decide whether the segment is RELEVANT or IRRELEVANT to the query.

Respond in JSON only, in this format:
{
  "reasoning": "Your reasoning here in one or two sentences",
  "final_label": "Relevant" | "Irrelevant"
}
RAW OUTPUT:
To determine if the segment is relevant to the query, I analyzed the content. The segment discusses collecting web behavior information, but does not mention keeping or selling user information for product marketing. Therefore, it doesn't directly address the query. 

{
  "reasoning": "The segment talks about collecting web behavior information, but does not mention keeping or selling user information for product marketing, which is the focus of the query.",
  "final_label": "Irrelevant"
}
REASONING: The segment talks about collecting web behavior information, but does not mention keeping or selling user information for product marketing, which is the focus of the query.
FINAL LABEL: Irrelevant

PROMPT:
You are a legal expert, classifier that determines if a segment of text from a document is relevant to a user query.

Query: "what control do i have as a user to limit the access to my account?"
Segment: "We may also tell other Viber users that you are using a certain service or app (to recommend them to try that service as well)."

Decide whether the segment is RELEVANT or IRRELEVANT to the query.

Respond in JSON only, in this format:
{
  "reasoning": "Your reasoning here in one or two sentences",
  "final_label": "Relevant" | "Irrelevant"
}
RAW OUTPUT:
Based on the given segment, it does not address the user's concern about limiting access to their account. The text instead talks about sharing information with other Viber users. Therefore, the segment is:

{
  "reasoning": "The segment discusses sharing information about other users, which is not directly related to controlling account access.",
  "final_label": "Irrelevant"
}
REASONING: The segment discusses sharing information about other users, which is not directly related to controlling account access.
FINAL LABEL: Irrelevant

ID: Keep _2_Keep _2_23_Keep _2_23_45
PROMPT:
You are a legal expert, classifier that determines if a segment of text from a document is relevant to a user query.

Query: "is any information shared with third parties?"
Segment: "We will ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health."

Decide whether the segment is RELEVANT or IRRELEVANT to the query.

Respond in JSON only, in this format:
{
  "reasoning": "Your reasoning here in one or two sentences",
  "final_label": "Relevant" | "Irrelevant"
}
RAW OUTPUT:
To determine the relevance, I'll analyze if the segment addresses the core concern of sharing information with third parties, especially sensitive personal information.
{
  "reasoning": "The segment discusses sharing sensitive personal information only with explicit consent, which indirectly implies that such sharing does occur. It does not explicitly deny or confirm third-party sharing, but it does address the context of sharing personal information.",
  "final_label": "Relevant"
}
REASONING: The segment discusses sharing sensitive personal information only with explicit consent, which indirectly implies that such sharing does occur. It does not explicitly deny or confirm third-party sharing, but it does address the context of sharing personal information.
FINAL LABEL: Relevant

  "final_label": "Relevant" | "Irrelevant"
}
RAW OUTPUT:
To determine if the given segment is relevant to the query, I'll analyze if it directly addresses the user's concern about sharing test results with third parties.
